# Cosmic Reach on Prism

This is a small project so that you can run [Cosmic Reach](https://finalforeach.itch.io/cosmic-reach) over on [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)


## How to install

1. Download the zip of this project
2. Import it into prism
3. Run!

## Note:

Currently this contains the build of Cosmic Reach over in the `libaries/cosmicreach-<version>.jar`.\
This jar is by FinalForEach, and all of that is owned by FinalForEach, not by me!

Feel free to check the hash with the version on itch.io until I create a script to automatically generate the Prism Launcher instance straight from Itch
